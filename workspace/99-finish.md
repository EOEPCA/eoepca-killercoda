We have learned in this tutorial how to deploy and use the EOEPCA Workspace Building Block - integrated with the IAM BB for authentication and access control, and configured declaratively via Crossplane custom resources.

To further evaluate the Workspace BB you might consider making a deployment in your own cluster by following the [Deployment Guide](https://eoepca.readthedocs.io/projects/deploy/en/latest/) - or jump to another one of the [EOEPCA Tutorials](https://killercoda.com/eoepca/).
