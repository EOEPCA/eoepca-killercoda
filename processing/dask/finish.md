We've successfully deployed and tested the EOEPCA Processing Building Block with an [OpenEO API](https://openeo.org/) interface and Dask distributed backend!

In this tutorial, you've learned how to:
- Deploy OpenEO backend services on Kubernetes
- Configure Dask Gateway for distributed processing
- Connect to OpenEO using client libraries
- Create process graphs for Earth Observation data processing
- Execute batch and synchronous jobs
- Monitor job execution and Dask cluster resources

You can now explore more advanced features or jump to another [EOEPCA Tutorial](https://killercoda.com/eoepca/).
