Welcome to the tutorial for deploying EOEPCA Processing Building Block with OpenEO ArgoWorkflows and Dask.

**OpenEO ArgoWorkflows** provides a Kubernetes-native implementation of the OpenEO API specification using Dask for distributed processing. This offers an alternative to the GeoTrellis backend, leveraging Dask's parallel computing capabilities for Earth observation data processing.

This tutorial assumes basic understanding of EOEPCA and Kubernetes.
