Welcome to the tutorial for deploying the EOEPCA Processing Building Block with the OpenEO Engine.

**OpenEO** provides a standardised API for simple and unified access to big Earth observation cloud back-ends. This tutorial guides you through deploying the OpenEO building block on a Kubernetes cluster.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:
- Deployed the necessary components for the OpenEO engine.
- Configured and deployed OpenEO Geotrellis.
- Validated the deployment and learned how to interact with the OpenEO API.

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of EOEPCA.
