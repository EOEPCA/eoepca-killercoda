## Configure Groups in the Application Hub

After having logged in with the `eric` user (password: `eoepcapassword`).

Visit the [Admin Panel]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_83}}/admin/) of the Application Hub.

1. Select **Manage Groups**
2. Create the following groups with exact naming:
   - `group-1`
   - `group-2`
   - `group-3`

3. After creating the groups, assign the `eric` user to each group and click **Apply**

These groups correspond to the profile access controls defined in the Application Hub configuration. Users in `group-1`, `group-2`, and `group-3` will have access to different application profiles.
