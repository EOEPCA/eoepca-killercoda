1. Navigate to the [Home of the Application Hub]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_83}}/) 

2. Click onto **Start my Server**.

3. Here, you have the opportunity to select your desired **Server Options**.

4. For this demonstration, click onto the first option **IGA - Stac Browser Earth-Search AWS**.

5. Click onto **Start** at the bottom of the window.

> You may need to wait for a few minutes while your server is being prepared.

Once ready, you will be automatically redirected and you will now have access to a STAC Browser running in your own profile.
