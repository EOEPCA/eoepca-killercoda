**Overview**

The EOEPCA **MLOps Building Block** provides integrated services for training, managing and deploying machine learning models. It uses three main components:

- **GitLab** for version control. For the purpose of this demonstration, you'll use a pre-configured external GitLab instance.

- **SharingHub** for discovering datasets and ML models.

- **MLflow** for tracking experiments, metrics and managing ML models.

It's recommended you're familiar with EOEPCA basics. If not, review the [EOEPCA introduction tutorials](../intro) first.
