**Overview**

The EOEPCA **MLOps Building Block** provides integrated services for training, managing and deploying machine learning models. It uses three main components:

- **GitLab** for code hosting and project management.

- **SharingHub** for discovering datasets and ML models.

- **MLflow** for tracking experiments, metrics and managing ML models.


You'll deploy the complete MLOps solution on Kubernetes, enabling an integrated ML workflow within EOEPCA.

It's recommended you're familiar with EOEPCA basics. If not, review the [EOEPCA introduction tutorials](../intro) first.
