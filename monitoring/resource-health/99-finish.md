We have learned in this tutorial how to deploy and use the EOEPCA Resource Health Building Block.

### Key Concepts

- **Health Check Templates**: Pre-defined patterns for common health check scenarios (e.g., `simple_ping`, `generic_script_template`)
- **Scheduled Checks**: Use cron expressions to run checks automatically
- **CronJobs**: Health checks are implemented as Kubernetes CronJobs
- **Telemetry**: Results are collected via OpenTelemetry and stored in OpenSearch

You can now play more with the deployed software, creating additional health checks or jump to another one of the [EOEPCA Tutorials](https://killercoda.com/eoepca/).
